* Construction *

Base                    : Wolfenstein 3D Hitler, but Wolfenstein 3D has no rotations.
Build Time              : I have no idea. I've started somewhere in 2007, left off and
                          continued at 13 april 2012....probably 25 days, every day a
                          hour or 4 tops.... (100 hours tops ??)
Editor(s) used          : Paint Shop Pro 6, XWE 1.16, SlumpEd 0.7, Slade3.0.2
Known Bugs              : none. Not really a bug, but hitler might not finish speaking active
                          sound "Die, hella schweinhund !" when he is under rapid fire attack
                          compared to the minichaingun of Skulltag.
May Not Run With...     : other than Doom- or Doom2 related game engines.
